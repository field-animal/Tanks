Tanks
=====

Tanks is a Scorched Earth style battle game written in c++. This was a project for Data Structures and Algorithms at UF, where we were to make a tanks style battle game in c++. Upon opening the game, The user will be prompted to enter the number of players. The terrain for the game is then randomly generated, and the players will be placed on the battlefield. The game board is 100 spaces wide, and 30 spaces talle. Each player will enter a power value (1-100) and an angle (0-180) for each turn, and an algorithm is then used to determine where the shot will go (note that for the angle 0 is east, and 180 is west).
